       <h2> About me</h2>
        <p> My name is Sam Campbell and I am an undeclared freshman at The University Of Rhode Island. I am from Wall New Jersey which is very close to the beach and is a great place to grow up. I am the youngest of four brothers and I have a black lab for a dog. Growing up I played hockey and golf. I enjoy being in the woods and hunting as well.</p>
